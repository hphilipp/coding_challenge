# coding_challenge
My contribution to the coding challenge from get in {IT} and bertrandt.

# Explanation
I was not shure about the use of external libraries, so I wrote two solutions.
Both solutions are written in Python and testet with Python 3.7.2.

The optimal solution is also stored inside the file `solution_path.txt`. 

# Solution with external library
This solution uses a Python Library named Dijkstar (https://pypi.org/project/Dijkstar/).
To run it, you first have to install the library with `pip install Dijkstar`.
Then simply run `python external_library_solution.py`.


# Solution which is self written
This solution is a self written implementation of the dijkstra algorithm.
There are no prerequieries, simply run `python self_written_solution.py`.
